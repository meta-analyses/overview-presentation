# Structure

## Agenda

-   Meta-Analysis
-   Physical Activity (PA) and its relationship with diseases/mortality
-   Outcomes of interest
-   Population Impact Fraction of recommended levels of Physical Activity
-   Code to access the dose-response curves

# Meta-Analysis

## What is meta-analysis?
-   A statistical technique for combining data from multiple studies on a particular topic.
-   As we go up the pyramid, each level of evidence is less subject to bias than the level below it
-   Meta-analyses can be seen as the pinnacle of evidence-based research
-   synthesizing evidence and summarizing the results of individual studies

## Meta-analysis of diseases and PA

-   Cardiovascular diseases -- such as heart disease and stroke globally responsible for 17.9 million deaths per year in 2019
-   Cancers are responsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2017

## Physical Activity

-   Physical Activity is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and Cancer
